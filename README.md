Project Summary: Music Player Application by Ashutosh,
Ashutosh has developed a dynamic Music Player Web Application that allows users to browse, play, and manage multiple playlists seamlessly. This project includes features for selecting different playlists, automatically playing songs, controlling playback, and adjusting volume—making it a highly interactive and responsive music player.

Key Features:
Playlist Management:

Users can switch between multiple playlists (e.g., songs, srk).
When switching playlists, the first song of the selected playlist plays automatically, providing a smooth user experience.
Playback Controls:

The player includes essential controls like Play/Pause, Next, and Previous buttons. These controls work seamlessly across different playlists.
The playback buttons ensure users can easily navigate through their song list without interruptions.
Volume Control:

Ashutosh integrated a volume slider that allows users to adjust the song volume dynamically.
A mute/unmute toggle feature was added using an interactive volume icon that switches between volume.svg and mute.svg based on user actions.
Auto-Play and Resume:

The last opened playlist and the last played song are stored in localStorage. This ensures that the user can resume their music from where they left off, even after refreshing the page or reopening the application.
Seekbar:

A fully functional seekbar allows users to jump to different parts of the song by clicking on the bar.
The seekbar is dynamically updated as the song progresses, making it easy to track the current position in the song.
Responsive Interface:

The application features a hamburger menu that allows easy navigation, especially on mobile or smaller screens. Users can toggle the menu to hide or display the playlist options.
Technical Implementation:
JavaScript: Handles all interactive functionalities, including playlist switching, playback control, and audio manipulation.
HTML & CSS: Provides a clean and interactive UI, where playlists are displayed and users can interact with playback controls, volume control, and song information.
localStorage: Used to store the last played song and the last opened playlist, enabling persistent state across browser sessions.
Ashutosh's Contribution:
Ashutosh put in a significant amount of hard work and dedication to bring this project to life. He meticulously ensured that each component—from playlist management to volume control—was implemented with attention to detail. His effort in making the user experience smooth and interactive is evident in the well-thought-out features like automatic song playback when switching playlists and the seekbar integration.

This project showcases Ashutosh's strong grasp of JavaScript, as well as his ability to create a user-friendly music player that not only plays songs but also provides a comprehensive experience for the user.
